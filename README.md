*DESCRIPTION* : 

   THE E-LEARNING PLATFORM UI IS DESIGNED USING REACT.JS AND TAILWIND CSS TO PROVIDE A STYLISH, RESPONSIVE, AND INTERACTIVE MULTI-PAGE INTERFACE FOR ONLINE EDUCATION. IT FEATURES A COURSE LISTING SECTION WHERE USERS CAN BROWSE AVAILABLE COURSES, A PROGRESS TRACKING COMPONENT TO VISUALIZE COMPLETION STATUS USING PROGRESS BARS, AND EMBEDDED VIDEO PLAYERS FOR WATCHING COURSE CONTENT DIRECTLY WITHIN THE PLATFORM. THE UI UTILIZES REUSABLE COMPONENTS SUCH AS CARDS AND BUTTONS TO ENSURE CONSISTENT DESIGN, AND IT IS STRUCTURED TO EASILY SCALE AS MORE COURSES AND FEATURES ARE ADDED. THIS FRONT-END LAYOUT SERVES AS A ROBUST FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING A FULL-FLEDGED ONLINE LEARNING SYSTEM.
